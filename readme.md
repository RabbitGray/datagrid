LM is a single PHP5 class for performing CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on a MySQL database table.

-   Define grids and forms by SQL statements or table name
-   Populate select, radio, and checkbox inputs with data from SQL statements
-   Upload documents, resize or crop images
-   Grid features include pagination, sorting, and inline editing. Searching can be added.
-   Grid uses SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, limit + offset for efficiency and low memory usage on large datasets
-   Built-in validation, error reported next to input
-   i18n/internationalization enabled. See i18n/template.php if want to submit your county + language file.
-   Lightweight; a single class

serving code snippets, document files, images and links.

Eventually there will be admin and users, to allow users to insert data but not remove it but for now everyone has control.
